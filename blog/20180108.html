<h2 id="overview">OVERVIEW:</h2>

<p>This is a tool for generating NHibernate Models and Mappings from an existing database (right now Oracle).  This tool can infer the relationships even if you don't have PK and XKs defined.</p>
<a name="endsummary"/>
<p>This contains a windows console application called ProjectBuilder.  It can be ran like...</p>

<p>EXAMPLE:</p>

<pre><code>"..\..\..\..\tests\Northwind\schema_generation\tables.txt" "..\..\..\..\tests\Northwind\schema_generation\northwind_schema.xml" "..\..\..\..\tests\Northwind" "Northwind" "" "..\..\..\..\tests\Northwind
</code></pre>

<p>USAGE:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table file&gt; &lt;serialized output&gt; &lt;nh path&gt; &lt;namespace&gt; &lt;plural indicator&gt; &lt;ignore list&gt;
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>table file: A file that lists the tables to work with.  Look at the file in tests\Northwind\schema_generation\tables.txt.  It will handle multiple schemas.</li>

<li>serialized output: It can serialize the output from exploring the database to an xml to save time.  Like if you need to change something, so you don't have to explore a remote DB again.</li>

<li>nh path: The path to where the NH mapping and model files will be placed.</li>

<li>namespace: The namespace to use</li>

<li>plural indicator: If your tables are like northwind "ITEMS" use "".  If they are "ITEM" use "s", this is used for the children properties to denote it's plural.</li>

<li>ignore list: Table prefixes to ignore, basically a file with wildcard.  For example if you named everything "TBL<em>ITEM" use "TBL</em>" in the ignore list file so your classes are called "Item" and not "TblItem"</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="howitexplores">HOW IT EXPLORES:</h2>

<p>Basically it will walk across the tables that are defined in the "Table File" via a database, the connection is defined in the "data-connectionStrings.config" file.  It will also look for relationships between tables.  It doesn't use the PK and XK relationships, it's based off the field names.  So if you have INVOICE.INVOICE<em>ID and you had INVOICE</em>DETAILS.INVOICE<em>ID it would infer a relationship of 1:* between INVOICE and INVOICE</em>DETAILS on INVOICE_ID.  It will do both sides of the relationships both parent and child.</p>

<p>If you are considering generating some mappings and models.  Review the Northwind solution in the tests folder for a sample NhFactory and a work around for the poor OracleDateTime support in NH.  Once you generate the mappings and models, I would build it, correct the errors and review the code that was generated.   A test project working thru the most common paths and how you might use it is also a good idea.</p>

<h2 id="whatdoesntitdo">WHAT DOESN'T IT DO?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Sequences, It doesn't look these up.  You would need to do them by hand.  So for inserts you would need to do these.</li>

<li>Only works with Oracle right now.  I tried to stick with what was discoverable via ADO and no special queries, so this should be portable to other DBEs.</li>

<li>Shorts which are bools or actually shorts.  It will try to guess based on the data it encounters.  Sometimes it might get it wrong.</li>

<li>There are row counts, you might want to change things around to optimize it.  FetchStrategy etc...</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sampleoutput">SAMPLE OUTPUT:</h2>

<p><strong>MODEL</strong></p>

<pre><code>using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace Northwind.Models
{
    //Model for NORTHWIND.CATEGORIES (8 rows)
    public class Categories
    {
        public virtual int Id { get; set; } //CATEGORY_ID
        public virtual string CategoryName { get; set; } //CATEGORY_NAME
        public virtual string Description { get; set; } //DESCRIPTION
        public virtual string Picture { get; set; } //PICTURE

        //CHILDREN
        public virtual IList&lt;Products&gt; Products { get; set; } //CATEGORY_ID [1:*] PRODUCTS.CATEGORY_ID
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>MAPPING</strong></p>

<pre><code>using NHibernate.Mapping.ByCode;
using NHibernate.Mapping.ByCode.Conformist;
using Northwind.Models;

namespace Northwind.Mappings
{
    //NHIBERNATE MAPPING
    //Mapping for Categories NORTHWIND.CATEGORIES (8 rows)
    internal class CategoriesNhMapping : ClassMapping&lt;Categories&gt;
    {
        public CategoriesNhMapping()
        {
            Schema("NORTHWIND");
            Table("CATEGORIES");
            Id(prop =&gt; prop.Id, map =&gt;
            {
                map.Column("CATEGORY_ID");
                //map.Generator(Generators.Sequence, gmap =&gt; gmap.Params(new {sequence = "DATA_FILE_ID_SEQ"}));
            });
            Property(prop =&gt; prop.CategoryName, map =&gt; map.Column("CATEGORY_NAME"));
            Property(prop =&gt; prop.Description, map =&gt; map.Column("DESCRIPTION"));
            Property(prop =&gt; prop.Picture, map =&gt; map.Column("PICTURE"));

            //CHILDREN
            Bag(prop =&gt; prop.Products, map =&gt;
            {
                map.Key(key =&gt; key.Column("CATEGORY_ID"));
                map.Cascade(Cascade.All);
            }, mapping =&gt; mapping.OneToMany());
        }
    }
}
