			<p>I took these notes when I was thinking and researching about how most of my calls go.  Some good and some bad.  I love talking on the phone, maybe too much?  But this is good advice.  Most of it came from a Grant Cardone video.</p>

<p><b>WHEN ON THE PHONE TRY TO DO THIS...</b></p>
<p>1. BE HONEST and TRANSPARENT</p>
<p>2. BE INTERESTING and INTERESTED</p>
<p>3. Believe you can make a sale from every call.  (avg sales follow up for calls is 8-12x calls, to get first call is 8x's calls for internet leads.  75% of sales people never call back twice!!!)</p>

<p>4. Identify and solve problems</p>

<p>5. Be logical and have structure</p>
<p>6. Be ENTHUSIASTIC, be RESPECTIVE, be MEMORABLE</p>
<p>7. Third Party Data, set yourself apart.  Texting on a call send them the data while on the call.  328% increase during closing.  500% to appointment show ratio.</p>
<p>8. Scripts  (Not conversations, controlled communications!)</p>
<p>9. Get to the close! Control the conversation.</p>
<p>10. Call Calculation.  How many calls?  Cost of calls?  What is it going to cost not to make the call? Cold, Warm, Hot....  How many calls???</p>

	<h4><b>BE UPFRONT, TELL THEM WHAT YOU WANT! SET THE STAGE FOR THE CALL!</b></h4>

<p><b>NEVER SAY:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Your name and company in the same sentence.</li>
	<li>Never, How are you?  Leads into a conversation.</li>
</ul>
<h4><b>INBOUND:</b><br/><center>GOAL IS TO CLOSE OR AN OUTBOUND SCHEDULED CALL</center></h4>
<center><h4><b>I AM THE GUY YOU WANT TO TALK TO!!!</b></h4></center>
<br/><br/>
<h4><b>OUTBOUND:</b><br/><center>GOAL IS A SCHEDULED CALL, OR CLOSE...</center></h4>
<center>
	<h4>Someone gave me your name and said you have a problem.</h4>
</center>
<center><h4><b>I AM THE GUY YOU WANT TO TALK TO!</b></h4></center>
