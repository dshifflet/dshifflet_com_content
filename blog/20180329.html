So I do a lot of examples with Oracle.  I just realized that not everyone has the Northwind Database in Oracle!
</p>
<p>
This repo on github has the DDL (Sql Build Script) where you can create it in Oracle.  I will write a more detailed post about how I am using Oracle with docker in the future.

Be warned the Northwind database has obnoxiousness, like why are the table names plural and not singular???  PRODUCTS vs PRODUCT?  It's not a good example of how to do a database, but it's useful for examples and testing because people are usually familiar with it.  It's very approachable.
