<p>
So I had created a Planning Poker game for Sprint Story estimation in the past.  It's <a href="https://github.com/dshifflet/PeerJS_PlanningPoker">available here</a>.
</p>
<p>
The problem was that Peer.JS uses WebRTC and in the absence of a decent TURN server (which I don't have) doesn't work well with NAT and people behind firewalls.
</p>
<p>
Solution: Use websockets.  So I got <a href="https://socket.io/">Socket.IO</a>, messed around with it and changed the old code to use it.  This solves the issues people were having with the firewalls and unable to join games.
</p>
<p>
To use it go <a href="https://dshifflet-poker.azurewebsites.net/">here</a>.  Type in a name.  Click new game.  To invite others copy and paste the share URL near the top.
