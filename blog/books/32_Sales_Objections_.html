		The non-fiction book "32 Sales Objections Easily Countered" by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=as_li_qf_sp_sr_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=dshifflet-20&keywords=Stepp Stevens Sydnor&index=aps&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=ur2&linkId=374825cfd86877895d3cc0e857feee40">Stepp Stevens Sydnor</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=dshifflet-20&l=ur2&o=1&camp=1789" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> is a book about countering the most common sales objections and pushbacks.  An example of an objections is "Is this the best price I can get?"  The book is split into two sections.  The first goes over the basics of countering objections, the second part lists the thirty two sales objections.  Each example objection has a list of Do's and Don'ts and a tip from the author.  I really enjoyed reading this book.

	<p>One exercise the author suggests is asking people when you buy things "Is this the best price I can get?"  DO THIS.  The results are amazing and will show you how most people can't or don't counter objections</p>

		<h3>Liked</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Easy to read and the book was well put together</li>
				<li>The Do's and Don'ts of the Sales Objections are really good.  Some of the Dont's are hilarious, but people use these!</li>
				<li>The Simple Statement that Diffuses Objections - "That's perfect because that's why I am here!"</li>
				<li>The advice from the book is easy to put into practice and works</li>				
				<li>The objections are very common.  Some are:
					<ul>
						<li>We aren't interested</li>
						<li>Your product is too complex</li>
						<li>I can't afford it</li>
						<li>I'm too busy</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		<h3>Didn't Like</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>There could have been more objections?</li>
			</ul>
		<h3>Overall</h3>
		<p>
		I really enjoyed this book.  If you are interested in countering objections, I would read this book.   One thing I have found when reading the sales books that are basically setup with different examples is to make a cheat/note sheet.  This really helps when I encounter an objection, I can look at my wall and it reminds me of something.  I also find myself flipping through the objections and reading them.  In fact reading the basics, and then randomly reading the objection chapters might be a good way to go through the book.
