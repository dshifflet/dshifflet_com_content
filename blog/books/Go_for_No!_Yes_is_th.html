			This is a very short, easy and fun to read book by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=as_li_qf_sp_sr_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=dshifflet-20&keywords=Richard Fenton and Andrea 	Waltz&index=aps&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=ur2&linkId=4cfacfc7d9a3dbe6d104a648a0658936">Richard Fenton and Andrea Waltz</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=dshifflet-20&l=ur2&o=1&camp=1789" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />.  The book has a clear message about the word "NO".  The book is written as a story where one man bumps his head and meets his more successful self in an alternate reality.
		</p>
		<p>
			The premise of the book is that you improve through failure.  It also makes it a point to remind the reader that looking to fail can be a successful approach.  A good example of this is how most people see "FAILURE - YOU -  SUCCESS" being like a needle where you want to avoid failure and keep the needle in the success portion.  The authors state that this is a better approach "YOU - FAILURE - SUCCESS", success can only happen through failures.   I believe this is true. I learn more from my failures than through my successes.

			The authors also have a chart in the middle of the book describing the five stages of failure:
			<ul>
				<li>Level 1 The Ability to Fail</li>
				<li>Level 2 Willingness to Fail</li>
				<li>Level 3 Wantingness to Fail</li>
				<li>Level 4 Failing BIGGER and FASTER</li>
				<li>Level 5 Failing Exponentially</li>
			</ul>
			Each chapter is oriented to teach you about each of these levels.
		</p>
		<p>
			Probably the best way of describing the major tenet of the book can best be described by an example, if you have a ten percent close rate and you need to close ten leads...  You will need to get ninety NOs.  So set out to get those ninety NOs, the closes will happen.  Maybe you will close more than ten?   Also think about how you can fail faster?  If it takes you a month to call one hundred people, find ways to call them and fail faster.  Instead of going into a pitch flat out ask them first "Do you want to buy life insurance?".  Most are going to say NO and that should speed things up.
		</p>
		<h3>Overall</h3>
		<p>
			This is a really good book.  It's also short and I think it delivers some great ideas about Going for No and improving your performance thru failure.
