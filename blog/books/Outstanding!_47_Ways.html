				<br/><b>Review:</b><br/>
This book was written by John G. Miller who is the author of QBQ - The Question Behind the Question.<br/><br/>
This book is composed of forty seven short chapters that vary in length between 3 to 10 pages about how to make your organization exceptional.  It is a quick read.<br/><br/>
<b>HOW NOT TO READ THIS BOOK:</b><br/>
Read it from front to back, then put it down.<br/><br/>
<b>HOW TO READ THIS BOOK:</b><br/>
Read it from front to back, then put it somewhere and flip thru it sometimes.  If there was a business improvement coffee table book this would be it.   Each chapter is small and can be read in about 10 minutes.  If you ever get bored instead of picking up the coffee table book of "Point Reyes Pictures" or "Steam Trains" pick this up and flip thru it and start reading.<br/><br/>
<b>OVERALL:</b><br/>
This is a pretty good book.  Even if you don't read it all, read parts of it.  Maybe even read random parts of it.  The chapters are pretty self standing and don't reference each other.<br/><br/>
