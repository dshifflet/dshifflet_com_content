				<br/><b>Review:</b><br/>
				A friend recommended I should read this.  This was a slow read, there was a lot of information to absorb.<br/><br/>
				The main message of this book is that clear and candid communication allows for better resolutions!<br/><br/>
				Overall it was really good.  It comes with two awesome tools the Get Stuff Done Wheel and the Radical Candor matrix.<br/>

				<b>Notes:</b><br/>				
				A good rule of thumb for any relationship is to leave three things unsaid every each day (p16)<br/>
				
				Be Clear, NOT MEAN.  Don't be Judgemental (p23)<br/>
				Get it right, rather than be right (p80)<br/>
				Get Stuff Done Wheel (p81)<br/>
				"When the fact's change, I change my mind." - John Maynard Keynes (p108)<br/>
				Telling other people how to feel will backfire  (p127)<br/>
				Have a go to question.  "Is there anything I could do or stop doing that would make easier to work with me?" (p132)<br/>
				<br/>
				Situation Behavior Impact - <br/>
					1. The situation you saw<br/>
					2. The behavior (what the person did, either good or bad)<br/>
					3. the impact you observed<br/>
				"I've been waiting for that parking spot for five minutes, you just zipped in front of me and took it.  Now I am going to be late"<br/>
				(p137)<br/><br/>
				Stating your intention to be helpful can lower defenses (p139)<br/>
				Being in a remote office is hard (p144) Daily check in calls.<br/>
				Say "That's wrong", not "You are wrong." (p147)<br/>
				Be More specific,  "You're too aggressive" is to abstract.  Provide examples (p159)<br/>
				Whale and monkey prizes (p166)<br/>
				Eighteen Month Plan (p181)<br/>
				Praise in public, say Thank You. (p196)<br/>
				List from (p204)<br/>
				The Getting started at the end!!!<br/>
