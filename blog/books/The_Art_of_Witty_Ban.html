		<p>The non-fiction book the "The Art of Witty Banter" by <a href="http://patrickkingconsulting.com" target="_blank">Patrick King</a> is a book that aims to teach you how to have interesting conversations.   The book was short and easy to read.  The subject is pretty approachable by anyone who has had a conversation, which should be most people on the planet.  I didn't think I got a lot out of reading this book.  However these are the things I liked and did not like.

		<h3>Liked</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>I thought the author's idea of setting boundaries on the length of conversations e.g "I have to go in ten minutes, but..."  This is an idea that is common in a lot of sales calls books.</li>
			<li>The Cheat Sheet at the end of the book.  These are really good notes, one wonders if this was the outline for the book?  I wish authors would include this more often.</li>
			<li>The book wasn't poorly written, no part felt copy and pasted.  A lot of these obviously made for Amazon books feel like someone wrote them in 15 minutes by copy and pasting poorly written blog entries.  (Like my blog!)  I did get the feeling the author spent some time and effort on the content and the book is approachable and easy to read.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Didn't Like</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Most of the ideas in the book are simple and common.  Simple works, but I didn't get much from reading this book.  Someone else who has problems holding conversations or maybe someone who feels socially awkward may get more out of this book.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Overall</h3>
		While the book was approachable and easy to read, the content inside of it seemed very simple and basic to me.  I did like the cheat sheet at the end.  That is a great idea that should be copied.  The book is pretty cheap and the kindle version is even cheaper.  I might read it again if I was super bored.
