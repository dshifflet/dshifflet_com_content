This is a short book written by

Maxwell</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=dshifflet-20&l=ur2&o=1&camp=1789" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
.  The book is about helping others.  The best part of this book is that it is short, clear and to the point.  You can read it in around two hours.
<br/><br/>
The author tries to make the point that training can help people and individuals.  I think this part of the book from page 100 gives an example of that:
<br/><br/>
	<ul>
		<li>When it's bad for the individual and bad for the organization -- everyone loses.</li>
		<li>When it's good for the individual but bad for the organization -- the orginization loses.</li>
		<li>When it's bad for the individual but good for the organization -- the individual loses.</li>
		<li>When it's good for the individual and good for the organization -- everyone wins.</li>
	</ul>
<br/>
The author also goes into developing the right mindset to help others learn.  From page 76:
<br/><br/>
	<ul>
		<li>B elieve in them</li><li>E ncourage them</li><li>S hare with them</li><li>T rust them</li>
	</ul>
<br/>
It's a short book and was pretty cheap.  The format and size of the book makes it feel like a Little Golden Book for adults.
